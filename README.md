# Policies

The `Policies` C# package is a framework for managing iterative processes using customizable and chainable policies.
At its core is the `BasePolicy` class, which provides a foundation for implementing rules that
govern the behavior of loops and iterations.
A `policy` defines a set of conditions and actions for controlling when and how
items in a sequence are processed or actions in a loop are executed.

Policies are designed to improve the modularity, maintainability, and clarity of your code, especially in scenarios
involving complex control flows or dynamic conditions.

## Why Use Policies?

The Policies package is ideal for:

* **Iterative Data Processing**: Apply rules to manage processing large datasets, throttling execution,
  or skipping items based on conditions.
* **Task Automation**: Define behaviors for retry logic, time-based delays, or other iterative processes
  in automated workflows.
* **Resilient Systems**: Build robust control mechanisms for systems that need dynamic or conditional loops,
  such as in fault-tolerant systems.
* **Modular Design**: Extendable policies make it easy to reuse and compose behavior for different scenarios.
